# ICU
Scripts for analysis of streaming multimodality ICU data for IRIS platform

Included are key pipeline scripts for accessing data from EEG or Moberg monitors. Most code is monitor/institution specific, but can serve as general guideline. Principle idea is intermittent queries for new data, form buffer, analyze data.

1) Pathway with master file pulling data from EEG network
-master
-readNicolet linked in separate github (can just include here)
-getData.sh and .m here
-lead integrity and sh
burst suppression and sh


2) Cannot publish code for pulling from Moberg monitor
-thresholds code
